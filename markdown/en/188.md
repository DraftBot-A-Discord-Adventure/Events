As you idly pass through the Road of Wonders, you close in to a motley gathering, seemingly immersed in something you can't quite discern yet, with how far you are. Coming in closer, you notice they are arranged in a semicircle around a heavy-bodied man. Getting closer again, you can fully apppreciate the fully-red, tight-fitting performance suit, complete with yellow shoulder-pieces and blue pants. The man's chest is also adorned with a royal-blue emblem, which you do not recognize. You carve yourself a path through the bystanders, until you get to the front. You finally understand the core reason for this unusual crowd : the man is, in fact, a beastmaster equipped with a long brown leather whip. At his feet lay two extraordinarily cute baby tigers, and the man is seemingly teaching them some tricks.

👀 Revel in the rare sight.
🗯 Call out the shameful act.
🚶‍♂️ Leave.

👀 
(1) You chose to stay here and see those spectacular animals, awed by the sheer cuteness they emit. You found this performance deeply pleasurable, so you give some coins to the trainer. 
(-70💸+10 ❤️)

(2) You wish to spectate this show, but it ends mere moments after you arrived. Even though you are deeply disappointed, you leave this place.
(Neutre)


(3) You glance at the training but, after all of your adventures, this isn't really anything impressive. You quickly leave the crowded area and continue your travels.
(-5m🕙)

🗯 
(1) You immediately understand the "rare beasts" are nothing but kitten. You are sure of this fact, as you already encountered actual tigers before, and their cubs are way bigger. You start and call out the scandalous scam, and demand that the scammers compensate you a great sum, or else you'll tell everyone about it. They accept your conditions, hoping you quickly get out of here.
(+500 💰)

(2) You see the trainer ready is whip, and know he's about to hurt the young beasts. As a greatly altruist person, you run up to him, shouting for him to stop his immense cruelty towards innocent newborns. He gets you and lashes as you with his weapon, to which the crowd cheers with glee.
(-25❤️, 🤕)

(3) The show is ending as you came and, as a great businessman, the trainer offers that, for a small fee, members of the crowd come up and pet the tigers. You shout with all of your strength, warning everyone that it is a massive scam and the "beasts" are simple kitten, but no one pays attention to you. You continue screaming your head off, but eventually take your leave.
(-30m🕙)

🚶‍♂️ 
(1) You are as indifferent as possible towards this "show", and choose to quickly leave the crowd before falling victim to any of the usual thieves. Those people, in fact, never let go of any opportunity to stealthily take riches from others, whether a lord or a peasant. Moreover, their shady endeavors are rendered easier by those kind of events where people are closely packed.

(2) You immediately go back to your travels. You cannot lose any time on such clownery. After a few steps, you realize you went the wrong way, so you turn around, deeply affected by the loss of those precious minutes.
(-5mn 🕙)

(3) You promptly leave the gathering, and stumble on a bag left to lay on the ground. You are slightly hurt. The bag is of a slightly-faded brown color, and even though its material is worn out, it is still in a pretty good state. You choose to explore the contents of this bag, hoping to find something to compensate your hurting leg. You discover a small bag of coins, as well as a maybe-useful item.
(-5❤️, +100💰, +item)

(4) You would rather continue your adventures than partake in the crowd's joy.

NR 
(1) You get out of the mass of people, and swiftly make your way towards the fatman's chariot. Inside this place, you see a cat with its children, and immediately understand the scam ! You go and bargain a good price from the trainer, in exchange for you keeping your mouth shut on this matter.
(+500💰)

(2) You wish to see the other tigers and, as you get behind the trainer's caravan, you witness an old man, paintbrush in hand, carefully transforming a cute pup into a ferocious beast. You leave while laughing wildly, happy you didn't get scammed by this team of "trainers".
(neutre)

(3) You get away from the mass, hoping to find a better place from where to see the show. Fully concentrated on the spectacle, you do not pay attention to where you put your feet, and fall into a wide open case, randomly laying in the middle of the road. You can't even begin to understand what's happening, that the case closes itself on you, getting you all dizzy.

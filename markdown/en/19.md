You go to the tournament's overseer, who accepts your participation, and asks you to choose a category in which to compete.

🐴 [1] After winning three consecutive jousts, you end up in finals against the Count of the neighboring region. He knocks you off your horses with bewildering ease and extreme nimbleness. You are thus the second-place on the podium. As the lord's wife, named Yseldia, gives you a heavy sack, you are captivated by her ruby-set crown. You absentmindedly take your prize from her fine hands. 
(+600$, -2h)

🐴 [2] A new joust is about to start. A groom gives you a grey cob, whose previous master died recently. You now face Yvan, a renowned knight. As you start galloping, so does your foe. He knocks you off your horce with ease and, as you violently smash onto the dusty floor, your mount unfortunately steps on a collarbone, which lets out a nasty crunch.

🐴 [4] As you feel the high of jousting taking over you, you realize you have no steed, and thus cannot partake in the event. With much disappointment, you choose to continue your journey, grumbling.

🎯 [1] This event seems a bit hard : you need to fire three arrows straight into a paillon sitting some fifty meters away from you. All three of your arrows manage to etch themselves into the straw target, winning you the first place. Yseldia, ghe local lord's wife, comes to you with a hefty sack full of gold coins. As she gives it to you, you're distracted by her ruby-set crown.

🎯 [2] This event seems a bit hard : you need to fire three arrows straight into a paillon sitting some fifty meters away from you. You aren't really deft, and two of your arrows miss the target entirely. You end up dead last. Still happy from partaking in the festivities, you resume your journey with a smile on your lips.

🎯 [3] As you notch your first arrow, a loud sneeze disrupts your moves. Your bow slips out of your hands, and the arrow flies straight towards a brawny knight, etching itself into a wooden panel, infinitely close to his head. The knight glances at you with a deathly stare, and starts moving towards you. You suddenly feel a great call for adventure, and quickly go away, resuming your usual journeying.


📜 [1] The crowd is captivated by your poem's rythm, rhymes, as well as its tone. You are crowned the ultimate winner. Yseldia, the Lord's spouse, hands you your prize, still moved by your art. 
(+700$,-30m)

📜 [2] A few minutes before the reveal of the results, you notice the sad disappearance of your purse. You guess it was stolen from you somewhen into the event. Thankfully, you only had on you a small part of your funds ! Still heartbroken by this loss, you go back to your travels without continuing on with the festivities.
(-100$,-1h)

📜 [3] As you deliver your poem with great poise, you notice a lovely lady eyeing you with much fervor. Just as you're finished with your bit, this lady holds your hand and runs away with you. A few streets away, the lady stops and kisses you passionately. You, however, are on the quest for the Princess, so you quickly explain to the lady that your heart already belongs to someone... As you bid this lady farewell, she insists on giving you an item so that you would remember her forever.

⚔️ [1] Upon seeing the sharp and shimmering weapons of the other competitors, your courage quickly melts away, much like snow under the sun. You chose to sneakily get away before being forced to depart from this world with unfinished business.

⚔️ [2] After narrowly escaping an otherwise-fatal halberd attack, from a finely decorated weapon set with green gems, you manage to defeat its wielder. The Herald of Arms announces your victory, and the Lord's spouse, Yseldia, hands you your prize in person. While thanking her, you carefully study her magnificent ruby-set crown.
(+800$, +1 item, -2h)

⚔️ [3] After easily getting rid of most of the competitors, you feel greatly tired, and loose your fight against the last standing person. You then notice a nasty gash in your hand, so you go to see the city's healer. He bandages your wound and insists on letting you rest properly.
(-1h, +40 PV)

⚔️ [4] You greatly underestimated your foes' might, and one of them knocks you down. Ignoring your pleas for mercy, your enemy, wielding an emerald-set halberd, snickers before tearing a deep gash in your arm.

🍴 [1] You find a street food stall, managed by a mixed-race woman. She's named Lucya, which strangely rings a bell... As you converse, she tells you she's worked for the famous Boug-Coton inn. She left because of her great thirst for adventure, and is now one of the travellers who, like you, roams the country doing various things, in the hope of winning the princess' hand. Happy with how your chat went, Lucya gives you a small flask of spiced mead. You feel revitalized, and ready to continue roaming on your own.

🍴 [2] You do not stumble upon any street food stall : an entertainer passing by tells you that a great feast will happen in a few hours. Unwilling to waste that much time, you get out of the city.

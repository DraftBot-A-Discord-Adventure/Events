You are wandering through a forest, when suddendly a beautiful woman runs toward you; she has long hair, the colour of sea-foam, and is dressed in a flowing silver gown, with the corset embellished by tiny sapphires. Moreover, she's holding a staff made of hawthorne in her right hand.
Her appearance makes you think of a what a fairy would look like, both wild and dazzling, if such creatures truly existed. And it makes you weary, as well, but the stranger kindly smiles at you and introduces herself as Donia.
She claims to be a fae, as you previously thought, and - although you don't believe her, thinking it might be a scam of some sort - you prefer to keep silent on the matter (that staff looks pretty dangerous, after all).
Oblivious to your thoughts, Donia offers you her blessings, thinking it might be useful in your path toward the princess.

1) accept her offer
2) refuse, risking her ire
3) try to find a compromise with the woman  

1.1: : you feel like you're partecipating to a knighthood ceremony, since Donia puts the end of the staff on both your shoulders to give you her blessings. Either way, you don't feel that much different from before.
1.2 : TODO

2.1 : you frown, telling her that fae don't really exist and she's just delusional. Enraged, Donia starts beating you up with her staff, leaving you wounded on the ground.

3.1 : she's a bit disappointed, but offers you a red rose as a gift for the princess; you'll get back on your way, also disappointed to have received just a single flower.

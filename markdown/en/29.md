1 : His speech voodoo you at a point at which you didn't react. You let yourself get drag into the tent. Inside, 3 merchants explain you that they're black dealers, selling organs and transplants to poor from the capital. Then, they jump on you, without you being able to react, and bone you to collect your vital organs. You die there, feeling the gaping hole inside your chest emptied of their kidneys, liver, and other money springs in you. (os, --money) 

2 : Continuing to walk straight, you ignore the shopkeeper's words, confused. You however continue your journey without pitfalls. (nothing) 

3 : Your steps more attracted by the tent than the road, you go in the marquee. The 3 merchants inside explain you that their chief is dead recently by wolves further and they're looking for someone to inherit of their superabundant goods. Your hand slide weirdly in the direction of the signature's sheet, marking that you become the heir of a new item and lots of money. Finally cleared, the sellers fold up the tent, and you continue your way, happy of the luck you've gotten. (+objet, ++++money)

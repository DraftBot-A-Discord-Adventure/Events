🍀 [1] After looking cows chewing fresh grass in the first wild grass field, you ran towards the second. Many sheep graze there peacefully. An impressive oak dominates the pastures and attracts your attention, so that you decide to approach it. A few meters from the tree, you discern a fork against the trunk. The peasant seems crazy when you give it back to him. He then grants you, as promised, a small purse filled with gold.

🍀 [2] As you approach pastures, you notice footprints. While following them, you are entering a dark grove in which you found a gloomy hut to say the least. Curious, you walk around it and find yourself face to handle with the so wanted fork! After coming back, you give the item to the farmer who thanks you a lot and invites you to share his meal so that you can tell him how you find it. The evening is pleasant and you leave the farmer late in the night, invigorated by local products.

:leaf_clover: [3] As you approach pastures, you notice footprints crossing the land leading to an inclosure where sheep benefit from the refreshing shade of young oaks. You decide to follow the footprints, thinking they'll lead you to the fork. When you arrive in the middle of the sheep, one of them comes to you. In a playful mood, you show him your hand with a bit of grass in it. He benefits of it to satiate himself, biting your finger while eating. Irritated, you decide to flee this place. Approaching the edge of the pasture, you do not see the fork on the ground, and walk over it. Furious about this misfortune, you are thinking about not helping anyone anymore on your adventure and throw the fork far away.

🐕 Seeing this desperated peasant, you decide to start looking for its fork. You end up at the edge of wild grass where cattles eat fresh herb quietly. Suddenly, a fawn dog, springs up from the premises of the pasture and gets on you. Faster than it takes to say so, you knock the dog out and get on your way like nothing happened.

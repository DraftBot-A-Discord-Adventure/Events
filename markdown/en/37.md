🦆 As you walk through the Célestrum Forest, you arrive in a clearing bordered by a small pond. The sun is beating down, you decide to walk along the water's edge, sheltered by the shade of the trees and accompanied by a light refreshing wind. This is the perfect time to take a break! Sitting cross-legged on the soft grass, leaning against a tree and enjoying the magnificent landscape before you, you observe a wild duck which, exhausted by its flight, decides to dive into the pond several meters from you.  

-🏊‍♂️ Take a dip in the pond  
-🥖 Try to bait the duck  
-🤾‍♂️ Throw stones at the duck  

🏊‍♂️ You decide to put your clothes on the branch of a tree. After feeling the temperature of the water with your foot, you take a dive. A few swims later, you return to the shore to dry off. Unfortunately, you didn't watch your clothes while swimming and it looks like a prankster took your shoes. Walking barefoot is not pleasant, so you trudge forward to the next town where you buy boots similar to those you had stolen. (-1h00; -200$)  

🏊‍♂️ As you dive, you find the water a little cold. So you have to swim to avoid freezing. Not knowing how to open your eyes underwater, you don't really look at the direction you're taking and continue straight ahead, breaking the duck's tranquility. The latter does not appreciate your presence and makes it clear to you. Waving its wings, it chases you to the shore. Your body took several pecks during the flight, inflicting minor injuries. (-10 hp)  

🏊‍♂️ Once immersed, the freshness of the water does you a lot of good. The calm and relaxing atmosphere then relieves you. You enjoy it a little. After about fifteen minutes of splashing around, the taste for adventure pushes you to set off again. (-15min, +5hp)  

🏊‍ You drop your clothes on the ground and rush into the water. You find it fresh. So you decide to swim a few laps. Coming out of the water, you notice that several people had the same idea as you. The idyllic character of this area will stay with you in your memory. You grab your things and continue on your way. (neutral)  

🥖 Grabbing an appetizing bait from your bag, you move closer to the water's edge, making little noises with your mouth to make the duck come. The ploy works, and you feed the animal! When he leaves, his movements release a little slime floating on the surface of the water. You then discover a few pieces scattered at the bottom. (+200$)  

🥖 You take care to make meatballs from a piece of bread from your supplies, then throw them towards the duck. Hungry, the latter doesn't miss a beat! After spending a good ten minutes watching him eat, you leave smiling. (-10 minutes)  

🥖 Despite your efforts, the duck doesn't seem interested in the bait you throw, and completely ignores you. Unhappy that a bird is resisting you, you continue on your way. (neutral)  

🤾‍♂️ You take advantage of a moment of inattention from the duck to grab a huge stone located near your location, and throw it with all your might at the idle animal. It disappears to the bottom of the water under the weight of the rock. Devoid of regrets, you continue on your way, in good spirits. (neutral)  

🤾‍♂️ As soon as the first stone is thrown, the poor creature flies away. Amused by the act of throwing stones, you start to make ricochets. In your amusement, you didn't notice the time passing. You will have to hurry to find a place to sleep if you don't want to spend the night under the stars! (-120min)  

🤾‍♂️ You start to stone the duck who, exhausted from his previous flight, cannot escape. Everything that passes under your hands serves as a projectile, whether it is stones, pieces of wood, pieces of bone lying on the ground... Even one of your bags filled with gold coins goes through in a moment of inattention. Realizing your mistake, you jump into the water fully dressed to look for her. Unfortunately for you, you don't find it in the murky, muddy waters of the pond. (-500$, -20min)  

🤾‍♂️ As you throw a stone, the animal, feeling threatened, takes flight again. You laugh, satisfied with your misdeed. However, you hadn't noticed that there was a group of people behind you. Your nastiness displeases them and they decide to make you suffer the same fate as the duck. So you run as fast as you can, protecting your head from the stones. You finally manage to outrun them. While catching your breath behind a tree, you happen to see some coins hidden in its trunk. (-20min, +$200)

🧠 You take advantage of this break to daydream. Soon after, you decide it's time to leave. (-10 minutes)  

😴 The rustling of the water, the light fresh wind, the pleasant shade provided by the trees as well as the cackle of the duck soothe you. The sandman has just passed by while the Sun has not completely set. (😴, +10 life)  

🚶 You stand there, lost in your thoughts. The flapping of the duck's wings brings you back to your senses. You decide to continue your journey. (-5 min)

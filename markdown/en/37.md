🦆 As you walk through the Célestrum Forest, you arrive in a clearing bordered by a small pond. The sun is beating down, so you decide to walk along the lakeside, sheltered by the shade of the trees and accompanied by a refreshingly light wind. This is the perfect time to take a break! Sitting cross-legged on the soft grass, leaning against a tree and enjoying the magnificent landscape before you, you observe a wild duck which, exhausted by its flight, dives into the pond a few meters from you.  

-🏊‍♂️ Take a dip in the pond  
-🥖 Try to bait the duck  
-🤾‍♂️ Throw stones at the duck  

🏊‍♂️ You put away your clothes, letting them rest on a nearby treebranch. After testing the water's temperature with your foot, you dive right in. A few swims later, you return to the shore to dry off. Unfortunately, you didn't watch your clothes while swimming, and it looks like a prankster took your shoes. Walking barefoot is not pleasant, so you laboriously trudge forward to the next town, where you buy boots similar to your previous, now-stolen ones. (-1h00; -200$)  

🏊‍♂️ As you dive, you find the water to be a little cold. You thus have to swim vigorously to avoid freezing. Unable to open your eyes underwater, you don't really know where you're swimming, and continue straight ahead, disrupting the duck's serene repose. The latter does not appreciate your presence and makes it clear to you. Waving its wings, it chases you to the shore. Your body took several pecks during the flight, and you end up with minor injuries. (-10 hp)  

🏊‍♂️ Once immersed in the pond, the water's chillness does you a lot of good. The calm and relaxing atmosphere relieves you of all small troubles. You enjoy it for a while, but after about fifteen minutes of splashing around, the taste for adventure pushes you to set off again. (-15min, +5hp)  

🏊‍ You drop your clothes on the ground and rush into the water. You find it fresh, prompting you to swim a few laps. Coming out of the water, you notice that several people had the same idea as you. The idyllic character of this area will stay with you in your memory. You grab your things and continue on your way. (neutral)  

🥖 Grabbing an appetizing leftover from your previous meal, to serve as bait, you move closer to the pond's edge, making little noises with your mouth to attract the duck. It works quite well, and you feed the animal! When it leaves, its movements clear away a portion of the mud floating on the surface of the pond, revealing a few coins scattered at the bottom. (+200$)  

🥖 You roll bread, taken out of your supplies, into little balls, then throw them towards the duck. Hungry, the latter doesn't miss a beat! You leave after spending a good ten minutes watching it eat. (-10 minutes)  

🥖 Despite your best efforts, the duck doesn't seem interested in the bait you throw out, and completely ignores you. Unhappy that a simple bird is going against your will, you continue on your way. (neutral)  

🤾‍♂️ You take advantage of a moment of inattention from the duck to grab a huge stone located nearby, and throw it with all your might at the idle bird. It disappears, sinking to the bottom of the water under the weight of the rock. Without feeling any guilt, you continue on your way, overflowing with happiness. (neutral)  

🤾‍♂️ As soon as the first stone is thrown, the poor creature flies away. Amused by this act of throwing stones, you start skipping stones on the pond's surface. In such a manner, times passes without your notice. You will have to hurry if you don't want to spend the night underneath the stars! (-120min)  

🤾‍♂️ You start to stone the duck who, exhausted from his previous flight, cannot escape. Everything that passes under your hands serves as a projectile, whether it is stones, pieces of wood or even bone lying on the ground... Even one of your bags filled with gold coins goes through in a moment of inattention. Realizing your mistake, you jump into the water fully dressed to look for the precious pouch. Unfortunately for you, you don't find it in the murky, slimy waters of the pond. (-500$, -20min)  

🤾‍♂️ As you throw a stone, the bird, feeling threatened, takes flight again. You laugh, satisfied with your misdeed. However, you failed to notice a group of people, following behind you. Your evil ways disgust them, and they decide to make you suffer the same fate as the duck. You run as fast as you can, protecting your head from the stones. While catching your breath behind a tree, after finally outrunning them, you happen to see some coins hidden in its trunk. (-20min, +$200)  

(end)  
🧠 You take advantage of this break to daydream. Soon after, you decide it's time to leave. (-10 minutes)  

😴 The rustling of the water, the light wind, the pleasant shade provided by the trees, as well as the cackle of the duck soothe you. Even though the Sun still hasn't set, you doze off into dreamland. (😴, +10 hp)  

🚶 You stand there, lost in your own thoughts. The loud flapping of the duck's wings brings you back to your senses. You decide to resume your journey. (-5 min)

(-20 min)

🏹 While you explain to the children how to position themselves at best to shoot, one of them, a little backward manages to bandage his bow, and, before you can do anything, shoot the arrow that comes to your leg. Wounded, you leave them to find a place to cure yourself.
🤕 (-25hp)

🏹 You explain to the children how to place themselves to shoot and the children do well. You spend the rest of the day training them in archery. Before you left them you were warmly thanked by a small present from your apprentices of the day. Vous reprenez la route, heureux d'avoir pu vous rendre utile.
(-190 min, item)

🏹 Very quickly, you notice that the children are not yet strong enough to tighten the rope, so you say that you will come back to train them when they are older and resume your journey.

👥 Not understanding the rules of the game very well, you are quickly put aside and resume your journey without the children worrying about you.

👥 You play with them until their parents arrive, finding you suspicious, they repudiate you from their village by threatening you. You get back on the road without asking for your rest.
(-5 min)

👥 Playing the role of the runaway you are chased by the kids. As you look over your shoulder to gauge the distance between them and you, you trip over a root and injure yourself. Children leave you to your sad fate when they see your inability to continue playing. You will need to be treated.
🤕 (-15hp)

❌ You refuse to play with childrens and go away.

❌ You refuse, and this has the consequence of annoying the children who pick up stones from the ground and throw them at you. In front of the rubble rain, you are forced to flee, out of reach of children. You realize that you have been hit in the head and the wound is bleeding profusely, you will need treatment.
🤕 (-20hp)

❌ You refuse, and the children get angry. Seeing that the situation could turn sour, you quickly hit the road.

END 1 Faced with your lack of respondent, the children lose interest in you and go to play elsewhere. So you resume your journey.

END 2 Seeing you lost in your thoughts, the kids tie the laces together. When you come out of this trance state, you stumble and fall face down on the ground.
(-5hp)

END 3 You just sit there for hours, and when you come back to your senses, you realize your purse is gone. You continue on your way, annoyed.

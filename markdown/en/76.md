ðŸŒ³ Probably because of the big storm of yesterday, a tree has fallen on the small path where you are walking. His trunk does 3 meters of thickness. It's blocking you the passage.

ðŸª“ Cut down the tree and continue

ðŸ§— Climb the tree

ðŸš¶ Pass by another path


ðŸª“ You take an axe from your bag and cut down the tree. It took you 30 minutes to clear your way! (-30m)

ðŸª“ You begin to cut down the tree and take a long time to cut the totality of it. You go to the nearest village, borrow a wain and his horse and carriage, come back to the forest, and load the cuted wood in the wain, come back to the village, and sell it to the cabinetmaker. It's only after all that you discover that a wain and his horse and carriage are more expansive that the wood of only one tree!

ðŸª“ You want to cut down the tree, but you realize that you don't have any tool. So you decide to climb the tree and did it whithout problems. You continue your road. (-6h, -250$)

ðŸª“ Then you were going to cut down the tree, you realize that you forgot an important detail when you took this decision: you don't have any tool to do it! Disappointed, you retrace your stapes.

After long hours of walking through the marshy road, you meet a woman at a crossroads. Exhausted, you ignore her but she, seeing your condition, calls out to you. This offers two paths that may be useful to you: one leading to an experienced alchemist who can get you back on your feet, the other being a shortcut.
